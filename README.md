# React Shop

A simple e-commerce application built with React, TypeScript, Material-UI, and Redux.

## About the Project

The React Shop project is a simple e-commerce application that allows users to browse a catalog of products, add items to their shopping cart, and view their cart contents. The application is designed to be responsive, meaning it can be accessed and used on a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Key Features

* **Product Catalog**: The application displays a list of products, which can be filtered and sorted by various criteria such as price, category, and rating.
* **Shopping Cart**: Users can add items to their shopping cart, and view their cart contents.
* **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, meaning it can be accessed and used on a variety of devices.

## Challenges

One of the most challenging parts of this project was implementing the product filtering feature. I had to design a system that would allow users to filter products by multiple criteria, such as price, category, and rating, while also ensuring that the filtering process was efficient and scalable. To achieve this, I used a combination of React state management and Redux to manage the filtering criteria and update the product list accordingly.
